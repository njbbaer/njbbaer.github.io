This website is the now and future home of my online presence as a software engineer. Learn how I built it and why in this post.

## Static Site Generator: *Jekyll*

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog focused static site generator built with Ruby.

Static sites consist of only fixed front-end content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They have no back-end resources, such as a database or business logic. This is ideal for a basic website, where speed and simplicity are more important than dynamic content.

Though every update to a static site requires a code change, a static site generator makes this process easy by building the site automatically from plaintext documents and configuration files. The content for this site can be viewed in its [repository](https://github.com/njbbaer/njbbaer.github.io).

I chose Jekyll specifically due to its deep integration with the GitHub Pages hosting platform, and my familiarity with the Ruby programming language.
